Initially, the books are in a balanced, precarious stack. The later frames show a hand reaching out and touching one of the books, causing the entire stack to collapse. The books consequently fall to the floor and scatter. There is no clear indication of a cat jumping onto the table in these frames. Instead, the collapse of the books seems to be initiated by the hand interacting with the stack."}, {"Q": "Did the person carefully remove one book from the middle of the stack?", "A": "No, the person did not carefully remove one book from the middle of the stack. The frames show that as the person attempts to remove a book from the middle of the stack, the entire stack of books collapses."}, {"Q": "Was the stack of books four books high before any were pushed?", "A": "No, the stack of books was three books high before any were pushed.
